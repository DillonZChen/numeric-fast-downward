# Numerical Fast Downward 

This is a work-in-progress repository for an extension of Numerical Fast Downward. 

Numerical Fast Downward (NFD), an extension of Fast Downward, has been originally developed by Johannes Aldinger and Bernhard Nebel.

## Build 

### Install LPSolver

#### CPLEX
Install CPLEX.
IBM provides a free academic lincense: https://www.ibm.com/academic/home

Suppose that CPLEX is installed in `/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1210`.
Then, export the following environment variables.

```bash
export DOWNWARD_CPLEX_ROOT=/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1210/cplex
export DOWNWARD_CONCERT_ROOT=/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1210/concert
```

#### OSI
Instal open solver interface.

```bash
export DOWNWARD_COIN_ROOT=/path/to/osi
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
wget http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Osi/Osi-0.107.9.tgz
cd Osi-0.107.9
./configure CC="gcc"  CFLAGS="-pthread -Wno-long-long" \
            CXX="g++" CXXFLAGS="-pthread -Wno-long-long" \
            LDFLAGS="-L$DOWNWARD_CPLEX_ROOT/lib/x86-64_linux/static_pic" \
            --without-lapack --enable-static=no \
            --prefix="$DOWNWARD_COIN_ROOT" \
            --disable-bzlib \
            --with-cplex-incdir=$DOWNWARD_CPLEX_ROOT/include/ilcplex \
            --with-cplex-lib="-lcplex -lm -ldl"

make
sudo make install
cd ..
rm -rf Osi-0.107.9
rm Osi-0.107.9.tgz
```

#### build

```bash
cd numerical-fast-downward
./build.py release64
```
